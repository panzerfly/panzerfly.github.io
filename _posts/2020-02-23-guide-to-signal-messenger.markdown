Earlier this year I was tasked to help in rewriting an Indonesian-made chat app, that project make me curious about chatting app, is there an open-source chat app that has a guaranted security?  <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is one that I found that not only easy to setup our own private server, but also has a great community support. During the process of learning how to deploy our own Signal Server, I saw a lack of comperhensive guide, that's why I decided to wrote a guide by compiling the guide from the community and adding my own solution to the problems i stumbled upon.

Edward Snowden himself recommended Signal on <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/986277159252750336">his Twitter</a>.  Follow this guide to start your journey on making your own signal chat messenger, but please do remember that this guide is meant for a starting point, to make your server even more secure, you need to do some hardening that meet your needs and that will not be covered by the guide.
